In this project, you will build a regression model using the Keras library to model the same data about concrete compressive strength that we used in labs 

 Concrete Data:

For your convenience, the data can be found here again: 
https://cocl.us/concrete_data 
. the predictors in the data of concrete strength include:

Cement

Blast Furnace Slag

Fly Ash

Water

Superplasticizer

Coarse Aggregate

Fine Aggregate
